## Here's a Minimal deploy.yml

## No tokens. No deploy logic. Just a log confirming the trigger.


name: Confirm Deploy Trigger

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  log-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Confirm deploy
        run: echo "âœ… Deploy triggered (actual deploy handled by Netlify)"
